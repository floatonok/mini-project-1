                <p>
                    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 30px">“</p>For those who, like ourselves, are convinced that architecture is one of the few ways
                    <br><br>
                    to realise cosmic order on earth, to put things according to reason,
                    <br><br>
                    it is a “moderate utopia” to imagine a near future in which all architecture will be created with a single act,
                    <br><br>
                    from a single design capable of clarifying once and for all
                    <br><br>
                    the motives which have induced man to build dolmens, menhirs, pyramids,
                    <br><br>
                    and lastly to trace (ultimate ration) a white line in the desert.<p style="color: blue; font-size: 30px">“</p>

                <p>
                    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 30px">“</p>“I did not want to find a monumental architecture

                    I did not want to find a fashionable architecture,
                    <br><br>
                    I did not want to find a beautiful architecture,
                    <br><br>
                    instead I always sought a ‘skinless’ architecture,
                    <br><br>
                    an architecture in which the outside arises from the inside,
                    <br><br>
                    straight out of the inner life of the men who live in it.”<p style="color: blue; font-size: 30px">“</p>
